# Product Refactoring Notes in the Age of Agentic AI

Over the past decade of my internet product career, I've been accustomed to drawing prototypes, writing documents, and tracking progress. Back then, software was **deterministic**: input A, and you inevitably get output B. If it output C, that was a bug that needed fixing.

But in the last two years, as I dived headfirst into the wave of Large Language Models (LLMs)—from independently developing "AI Assistants" to designing enterprise-level "AI Coaches"—I've found that the rules of the game have completely changed. We are no longer designing a "tool," but rather hiring and managing a group of "silicon-based employees."

This is also the trend that Professor Andrew Ng has recently emphasized: **Agentic Workflow**.

Today, I want to talk about the "new worldview" from a product manager's perspective in this new era.

### I. Don't Treat AI as a Search Engine; Treat It as an "Intern"

Many people find AI difficult to use because they are still using the logic of a **"search engine"**—throwing in a keyword and expecting a perfect answer. In the AI field, this is known as **Zero-shot prompting**.

If you directly ask an AI to "play a picky customer practicing with a salesperson," it usually acts like a robot just reading lines. But if you change your approach and treat it as a **"smart intern"** who just joined:

**Give Context (Persona):** "You are a customer who cares a lot about cost-effectiveness but is also a bit vain."

**Give Process (SOP):** "Listen to the salesperson first. If they don't mention 'prestige,' deliberately make things difficult for them."

**Give Feedback (Reflection):** "After this round, reflect on whether you were too easy to talk to just now. Be stricter in the next round."

This is the essence of **Agentic Workflow**.

This process can be summarized as the **PAR Model (Plan-Act-Reflect)**:
